The guiding principle behind duawranglr is to make it easier for
organizations to share data that contain protected elements and/or
personally idenfiable information (PII) with researchers. There are
two key problems this package attempts to solve:

1. Data owners and reseachers may wish to collaborate on multiple
projects, each with a different level of data security required;
executing a unique data usage agreement (DUA) for each project can be
time consuming and inefficient.  
2. Administrators tasked with approving data requests do not always
have the time or technical proficiency to closely review the code that
reads, subsets, filters, and deidentifies data files according to a
DUA.

This package offers a set of functions to help users create shareable
data sets from raw data files that contain protected elements. Relying
on master crosswalk files that list restricted variables, package
functions warn users about possible violations of data usage agreement
and prevent writing protected elements.
